### What is UltraLangScript?
Like UltraLang, UltraLangScript's purpose is to let you learn one language that runs in many places. UltraLangScript is a JavaScript library, but it is still eventually going to run on:
- Websites
- HTML5 Apps (using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) or [Windows Universal Platform with JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/create-a-hello-world-app-js-uwp))
- Chrome Apps and Extension
- Servers (via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org))
- Raspberry Pi (also [Node.js](https://nodejs.org))
- Mobile Apps?

### How can I use UltraLangScript?
UltraLangScript is still in development, but updates on how it can be used will be posted here.
